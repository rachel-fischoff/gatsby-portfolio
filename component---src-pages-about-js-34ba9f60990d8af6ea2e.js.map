I am a scorpio sun, with a scorpio rising, and a\n      leo moon based in Durham, NC. As a full stack software engineer, I\n      approach problems by incorporating best practices for front end, back end &\n      data engineering. \n      <br />\n      <br />\n      I'm proficient in building applications using the MERN Stack (MongoDB,\n      Express.js, React.js and Node.js) in addition to HTML/CSS, WordPress,\n      Python/Flask & MySQL. I've began contributing to open source software & I am\n      excited to contribute more projects. \n      <br />\n      <br />\n      From UX/UI to querying databases. From creating API architecture to\n      Machine Learning. Not to mention the classic day to day debugging; I\n      thoroughly enjoy being an engineer.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Iâ€™m always willing to volunteer my time and knowledge for applications and websites focused on\n      improving the lives of Black folx. More specifically, projects for trans Black\n      folx, queer Black folx and/or projects that increase access to mental health services.
