I am scorpio sun, scorpio rising, and leo moon based in Durham, NC. As a full stack software engineer, I solve problems in a way that incorporates design. From UX/UI to querying databases to creating API architecture to Machine Learning and the day to day debugging, I thoroughly enjoy being an engineer. I find the endless amount of resources and constant evolving of technologies to be tantalizing. My primary technologies are the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js). I’ve also worked with HTML/CSS, WordPress, Python/Flask & MySQL. I’m always willing to volunteer my time & knowledge on projects that either work toward social justice or are open source.
